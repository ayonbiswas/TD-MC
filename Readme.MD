# ECE276B Project 4 : TD and MC using Value function approximation

Description
===========
This is project on VI and PI is done by Ayon Biswas[A53318795] and Ria Aggrawal[A53304030].

Dependiencies Used
==================
* scipy  
* numpy 
* pandas 
* keras
* https://github.com/MeepMoop/tilecoding (for tilecoding)

Code organization
=================
* /deep/neural_net.py -- Run the script for performing TD or MC using neural networks. Set the appropriate class for the technique to be used.

* /linear/linear_features.py -- Run the script for performing TD or MC using user defined linear features. Set the appropriate class for the technique to be used.

* /tilecoding/tilecoder.py -- Run the script for performing TD or MC using tilecoding. Can change the number of tiles and bounds of state space. Set the appropriate class for the technique to be used.

* /offpolicyMC/OffpolicyMC.py -- Run the xript to perform off policy MC.

Each folder also contain plots and videos on test environments.
